# Characters: homages and animals

The runners are a cast of fourteen: ten homages to famous game characters in our own designs, and four plain animals for contrast. In the lore (DESIGN.md) they're the characters who never made the cut, from stray animals to knock-off heroes who almost got their own game. Each kind is a character design of its own, the way the barnyard party game's animals are: its own outline, its signature props, and a way of moving.

`pnpm shot cast` shoots the sheet: the 8-player lineup at play scale on farm and mine, the race start, deaths, a 3× close-up, the lobby cards, the "is it the homage?" sheet (`cast-recognise.png`), the silhouette test (`cast-silhouettes.png`) and the catalog of every kind (`--only catalog` for the last three). In the console, `slagDebug.cast` has `catalog()`, `silhouettes()`, `recognise()` and `bench()`.

## Decisions

From the owner (logged in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) → Characters):

1. **Mostly homages.** About two thirds of the cast parodies famous game characters; a few plain animals stay for contrast.
2. **Recognisability comes first.** A stranger should name each homage at a glance. For each one we list the three or four traits people actually know it by and make every one of them unmistakable at play scale.
3. **Homages, never copies.** Each is our own design, read from its silhouette and one or two signature props, never the original's exact design or its real name. Sound-alike names are data (`KIND_NAMES` in `src/gen/character.ts`) and appear nowhere else. Player characters may have faces and personas; parts and machines stay faceless (DESIGN.md → Parody).
4. **The iconic palette wins, and the player's color moves.** A homage keeps the colors it's known by (the plumber's red cap and blue overalls, the speedster's cobalt, the mouse's yellow). The player's color goes on a secondary but always-visible slot: a flat ring at its feet, no glow. A plain animal, or a homage that comes in every color anyway (the impostor crewmate, the puffball), is drawn in the player's color. Either way it's that player's HUD color, and with eight different kinds per lobby plus the ring, eight players stay told apart.
5. **Random roll only.** New Look rolls everything, the kind included. A lobby never seats two of the same kind (`Match.looksFree`).
6. **Saved looks re-roll once** whenever the cast changes what a seed means: `LOOK_CAST` in `src/ui/profile.ts` (now 6).
7. **Clean, light, hand-drawn.** A thin pen that varies along the line, in a dark of the body's own color; two or three flat tones per surface; one soft, hard-edged shadow shape; calm color; no glow.

## The bar

What polished small-character games do, and what we hold the cast to:

- **Silhouette first, judged at real size.** Clever Endeavour judges *Ultimate Chicken Horse* art in the game at actual scale, added Snake for "a unique silhouette", and dropped a reskin that read in-game as "a beige Snake" ([Behind the scenes: Snake](https://cleverendeavourgames.com/blog/2020/9/21/behind-the-scenes-snake)). Mediatonic tells *Fall Guys* designers to zoom out and check the main elements still read ([PlayStation Blog](https://blog.playstation.com/?p=224711)).
- **Few colors, chosen hard.** Yacht Club holds *Shovel Knight* characters to about five colors each, inside an NES-like palette, and iterated the Hengineer's silhouette and attitude until both were solid ([Kotaku](https://kotaku.com/how-a-shovel-knight-npc-gets-made-1842271950); [Shovel Knight: Official Design Works](https://shovelknight.fandom.com/wiki/Shovel_Knight:_Official_Design_Works)). A grayscale check of contrast is a standard test ([80.lv](https://80.lv/articles/celeste-fan-art-highlighting-character-with-texturing-pose)).
- **One trait carries identity; color tells players apart.** Multiplayer Kirbys differ by color alone ([WiKirby: Color](https://www.wikirby.com/wiki/Color)); a fighter's icon is its silhouette plus one prop.
- **Readability and juice in motion.** *Celeste*'s tiny protagonist reads through pose and a strong line of action more than through detail ([review notes](https://www.sonicstadium.org/blogs/entry/384-spoilers-brief-thoughts-on-celeste/)).

So each kind has: a clear head-to-body ratio, a readable expression, a line of action in its run and jump poses, secondary motion on its garments, ears and tails, brows that react, and more detail at card and menu scale (a third, lit tone) than at play scale.

## The cast

| Kind | Homage (what a stranger should say) | Signature traits | Player's color |
|---|---|---|---|
| plumber | the mustached plumber | red cap with a round white badge (our own mark, a little wrench, never the letter), big round nose, thick mustache, blue overalls with two gold buttons, white gloves, brown shoes; big head, stout | ring at the feet |
| hedgehog | the blue speedster | cobalt, spikes swept straight back, joined eyes with green irises, peach muzzle and belly, a one-sided grin, red sneakers with a white strap; runs leaning hard, spins in the air | ring |
| elf | the green-tunic elf hero | long green cap flopping back, pointed ear, blond fringe, flared green tunic with a belt, a kite shield and a sword hilt on the back | ring |
| hunter | the armored bounty hunter | orange armor, huge round red shoulder pads, a round helmet with a green visor, an arm cannon held out | ring |
| zapmouse | the yellow electric mouse | yellow, long ears with black tips, red cheeks, a lightning-bolt tail, brown back stripes | ring |
| impostor | the impostor crewmate | a bean on stubby legs, a wide pale visor standing proud, a backpack | body |
| puffball | the pink puffball | a ball on big red feet, stubby arms, tall eyes with a shine, blush; puffs up in the air | body |
| jelly | the jellyfish parasite | a translucent green dome, three red nuclei inside, four ivory fangs, a hovering bob | ring |
| goose | the goose up to no good | white, orange beak and feet, an S of a neck; on the run the honk pose, neck flat out and wings up | ring |
| engineer | the team shooter's engineer | yellow hard hat with dark goggles on it, a square jaw, a red or blue work shirt, khaki trousers, a leather glove, a huge wrench | ring |
| fox | — | long and low, snout out front, tall ears, bushy tail carried up | body |
| frog | — | crouched flat, two eye bumps; crouches and leaps | body |
| penguin | — | upright egg, pale front, flippers; waddles | body |
| chicken | — | tall and bottom-heavy on thin legs, red comb; struts | body |

**Is it the homage?** `cast-recognise.png` puts each kind close up beside "This is ___". As of this round, every homage reads as its caption to us: the plumber, speedster, elf, mouse, impostor, puffball, jelly and goose at once; the bounty hunter and the engineer a beat slower, because their reads lean on props (the shoulder pads and cannon, the hat and wrench) more than on a silhouette nobody else shares. The silhouette test still separates every kind, though the plumber and the hunter are the closest pair of stout shapes.

## What every kind keeps

- **One hitbox, one physics.** Every kind is drawn around the same 14×15 world-px body, inside the range the old blobs used. Hats, ears, tails, shields and wrenches are thin or behind the body. `tests/ink-character.test.ts` holds every kind inside one box around the hitbox, standing on the floor.
- **Outlines as data.** Each silhouette is authored as curves, facing right, in body units (`outline` in `src/render/cast/kinds.ts`), with variants where the line of action changes the shape (the goose's run). Sampled once per kind and pose.
- **The body bends.** Squash and stretch bend the outline; each kind's `gait` adds its own hop, rock, spin or waddle about its own pivot. Caps, ears and tails sway on their own.
- **Faces belong to the kind** (`src/render/cast/faces.ts`): cartoon eyes with irises, highlights and brows that set on a run, lift on a jump and worry on a fall; a visor, goggles or a side eye where that's the character.
- **Glass.** The jelly's dome is translucent (no ink mass under it), the one see-through body.
- **Death.** Shards of the character's colors, and a few kinds' own bits (the plumber's coins, the engineer's bolts and springs).
- **Determinism.** `generateCharacter(seed)` is a pure function of the seed, and the kind is one of its rolls.
- **Cost.** About 0.04–0.07 ms per runner on a software canvas; outlines are sampled once per kind and pose, and nothing needs baking.

## Adding a kind

Add the id to `CAST`, its sound-alike name to `KIND_NAMES` and its own colors to `PAINTS` (`src/gen/character.ts`), and a `KindArt` to `KINDS` (`src/render/cast/kinds.ts`): an outline inked as curves facing right, the three or four traits people recognise, a gait, a face, the player's color on the body or a `ring`, and the parts it breaks into. Add its caption to `READS_AS` in `src/render/cast/sheet.ts`. Then run `pnpm shot cast` and look at `cast-recognise.png` and `cast-silhouettes.png`: if a stranger wouldn't name it, or its silhouette could be mistaken for another kind's, it isn't done. A new kind changes which kind every seed rolls, so bump `LOOK_CAST` with it.

## History

- **Phase 1** proposed three directions; the owner picked foundry toys.
- **Rounds 1–3** built the toys and the hand-authored outline, gait and silhouette-test system.
- **Round 4** swapped the toys for animals and a few parody critters, drawn lighter.
- **Round 5** made the cast mostly homages, put recognisability first (iconic palettes, the player's color on a ring), and raised the craft: proportions, reacting faces, pose outlines, a card-scale rim tone.
