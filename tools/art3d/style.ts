/**
 * The prompts a kind's 3D model is made from (tools/art3d/README.md, step 1). Three stages, as a studio
 * would run them:
 *
 * - **Concept**: a model sheet in the game's own style, to judge the design. `STYLE` is the traced
 *   spike's paragraph (docs/ART.md's "World art: ink" and docs/CHARACTERS.md's "clean, light,
 *   hand-drawn" in a generator's words), kept word for word so the two pipelines draw the same cast.
 * - **Pose sheet**: the concept through every pose the game plays, the reference the renderer's keyed
 *   poses are set from where motion generation can't make them.
 * - **Model sheet**: the same design as a figure for image-to-3D: one figure, front on, in a T-pose,
 *   flat matte colour with no ink and no painted shading, on plain grey. Ink and shading are the
 *   renderer's job; a line or a shadow painted into the texture would bake into the model as a smudge.
 *
 * A brief describes traits only. It never names the character or the game it pays homage to: each kind
 * is our own design (docs/DESIGN.md → Parody, docs/CHARACTERS.md → Roster). Each brief's comment lists
 * the nod (what the read needs) and the twist (what's ours, and the joke).
